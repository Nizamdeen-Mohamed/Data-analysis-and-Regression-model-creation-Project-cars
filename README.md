# Data preprocessing and model creation 
Develop Python code for cleaning and preparing data for analysis - including handling missing values, formatting, normalizing, and binning dataPerform exploratory data analysis and apply analytical techniques to real-word datasets using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Scipy.Manipulate data using dataframes, summarize data, understand data distribution, perform correlation and create data pipelines.Build and evaluate regression models using machine learning scikit-learn library and use them for prediction and decision making.
